## HIGHLIGHTS

- Overall, we propose a pipeline for PRNU noise extraction using CNN and then classify it in this paper.
- We used the traditional wavelet method to extract the PRNU noise on the VISION dataset.
- We use the Resnet-based CNN model (modeled CSI-CNN architecture) to extract PRNU noise from Residual noise to enhance the utility of camera fingerprinting.
- Based on the PRNU noise obtained using the above Resnet-based CNN model we tried to use a DnCNN-based model as well as a Sample CNN model for classification.
- On the basis of discarding the directly obtained PRNU noise, we directly use DnCNN and a Sample CNN model to extract the high-level features of Residual noise, in other words, try to keep the complete PRNU noise structure, and then conduct classification experiments respectively.

## The Proposed Methods

Figure 1. The pipeline we proposed for image source forensics. I is the original image from dataset, F function is denoise filter, W presents the residual noise. The final result is K classes, where K represents the number of classes.

The details of  model Resnet-based CNN for getting PRNU as follows.

 Figure 2. The Resnet-based CNN is modeled and modified after CSI-CNN architecture, here is the modified CSI-CNN architechture of the PRNU generate model..


After get the PRNU dataset, we use the following model to classify them.

## Experiments

We use the VISION dataset for experiments.
